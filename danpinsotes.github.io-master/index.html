            <p> Love by definition is a feeling of strong or constant affection for something or someone. However, to different people love can be expressed in different ways - whether it is through words or physical actions. To most people it means to merely follow your current feelings.
Though in reality, love is about commitment and it should be unconditional. The word unconditional means that there are no expectations or limitations. Love is when you would do anything for the betterment of the relationship. Love is a bit rough, but love is what makes it worth it.

    </div>
        <div class="p">
            <p>It is common to hear that love should be unconditional, however the reality is that humans can only love conditionally. It is part of human nature to do so. The Bible tells us that God is love. A note on perhaps the most common Bible verse says that God loved us so much that he gave his one and only son so that whosoever believes in him will be saved. He sacrificed his only son to us so that we will not spend an eternity separated from him. We chose to reject God and yet God still sacrificed for the betterment of the relationship. Moreover, Christ died for us sinners. Jesus never said that he will love us only if we repent. Even though we are born sinners He still loves us the same way and is just waiting for us to love him back. This is the true meaning of Love -  a love that is unconditional.

        A love letter is typically for another human being in the world, but the only one who truly deserves one is someone who loves us unconditionally. Thank you for everything you have given me, and for all the blessings. Thank you for always listening and being there for me when I needed you to be. I was always lost but somehow you always bring me back to the right path. I regret every single time I resented you and got mad at you. You never deserved that treatment after everything you have done for me. I want to get closer to you. I want to learn more about you. I want to understand how you see the world so I can also look at the world with love. You were really the only person who loved me unconditionally. Thank you God.
